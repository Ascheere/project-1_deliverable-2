Project 1 - Deliverable 2: POC Code

So I didn't add the vendor file because of its size please tell me if thats needed. This is my first time using github extensively
so I hope my pull request is correct. I implemented everything you mentioned in the assignment readme. 

I am sending the following, 

A .paw file that has all of my request code on it I used the terminal listener for the index file at local:8888

The Src folder of my php storm project that has the index file with all of the php code. 

I also added the composer.json and the composer lock
